Head First C# - Lab 1 - A Day At The Races

This is my take on the first lab in the Head First C# 3rd edition. The app simulates a dog betting parlor. Some of the key features include:

1. A track that visually moves the dogs
2. A betting parlor that allows three bettors to place bets between $5 - $15
3. That's about it
